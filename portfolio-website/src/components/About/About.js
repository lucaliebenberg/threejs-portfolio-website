            I am an interaction designer and developer, who is extremely
            enthusiastic about the blockchain ecosystem and software
            development. I work with Front-End technologies - such as HTML, CSS
            and JavaScript. I am constantly learning frontend and blockchain
            technologies, such as Solidity, to understand secure smart contracts
            and grow as a Fullstack Javascript/Blockchain developer. I enjoy
            building websites for creatives, friends and family, and as a
            freelancer. Establishing a digital presence in modern society is
            crucial for marketing your brand or oneself, so I plan to help those
            in need and create digital voice's for those who do not have one.ÃŸ
